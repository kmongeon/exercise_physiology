The estimation results are summarized in Table 2. All level-1 fixed
effects and level-2 random effe cts were found to be significant at the
0.01 level. To facilitate straightforward comparison of the causal
effects, all variables were transformed/standardized to a mean of zero
and standard deviati on of one. Conclusions based on non-standardized
values support identical inferences.

The results are consistent with the relationships postulated by the
functional model of bone develo pment. Physical maturity and nutrition
influence muscle strength, which in-turn, along osteoclast a ctivity,
and physical maturity influences bone properties. Although physical
maturation has both di rect and indirect impacts bone properties,
physical maturation and muscle strength had similar tota l impact. In
terms of standard unit changes, the direct impact of muscle strength and
physical matu ration on bone pro
