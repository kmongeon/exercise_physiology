Statistical Analysis 

The repeated sampling of participants resulted in a hierarchical data set that consisted of within (level 1) and between (level 2) measurement variations. Table 1 outlines the variables used in the analysis, their means, and their standard deviations within and between participants.

When rho is zero, the panel-level variance component is unimportant, and the panel estimator is not different from the pooled estimator. A likelihood-ratio test of this is included at the bottom of the output. This test formally compares the pooled estimator (tobit) with the panel estimator.
