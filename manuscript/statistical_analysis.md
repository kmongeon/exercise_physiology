Statistical Analysis 

The repeated sampling of participants resulted in a hierarchical data set that consisted of within (level 1) and between (level 2) measurement variations. Table 1 outlines the variables used in the analysis, their means, and their standard deviations within and between participants. 


the mean and variance decompostions of the Functional Model of Bone Development variables. 


When rho is zero, the panel-level variance component is unimportant, and the panel estimator is not different from the pooled estimator. A likelihood-ratio test of this is included at the bottom of the output. This test formally compares the pooled estimator (tobit) with the panel estimator.


According to this model, specific modulators influence muscle strength, which in turn, along with other cellular modulators related to osteoblasts/osteoclasts, influence bone properties (see Figure 1).

In SEM terminology, muscle strength is mediates the effect of modulators on bone properties. 



The empirical specification of participant's radial and tibial bone property changes is expressed as

$$ Y_{i,t} = B {M}_{i,t} + \Theta Z_{i,t} + \gamma_{i} + \epsilon_{i,t} $$
$$ M_{i,t} = \Omega Z_{i,t} + \mu_{i,t} $$
