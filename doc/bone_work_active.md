**ABSTRACT**

This study provides experimental evidence in support of the conceptual
functional model of bone development postulating that the primary mechanical
challenges to bone’s mechanostat during growth is increases in muscle force.
This longitudinal study measured radial and tibial bone properties, isometric
grip and knee extensors strength, and maturity in 172 children aged 8-15 years
2-3 times over a period of 3 years. Both the conceptual model and research
design motivates the multilevel structural equation that explicates the
relationship between strength and physical maturation on bone properties.

**INTRODUCTION**

The functional model of bone development postulates that the primary mechanical
challenges to bone’s *mechanostat* during growth comes from increases in muscle
force (Frost, 1987; Rauch & Schöenau, 2001). This suggests that the growth of
bone and muscle are closely associated, and that bone must adapt its strength to
withstand forces from muscle contractions (Schöenau & Fricke, 2008; Schöenau &
Frost, 2002). Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated positive relationships
between bone properties and muscle mass or force in youth (Janz et al., 2015,
Macdonald et al., 2006; Schöenau et al., 2000, 2002; Wang et al., 2007; Wey et
al., 2011). Moreover, correlations between lean body mass and bone mineral
content, which are surrogate measures of muscle and bone strength, have been
reported during the growing years (Faulkner et al., 1993; Manzoni et al., 1996),
with a temporal association between muscle and bone development (Rauch et al.,
2004). To support the *Mechanostat Theory* notion of muscle mass or force
driving bone strength, the peak rate of increase in muscle mass (Rauch et al.,
2004) and presumably, muscle strength, has been shown to occur before the peak
rate of accrual of bone mass (Rauch et al., 2004) and bone strength (Jackowski
et al., 2009). Since the temporal accrual of muscle mass and bone mass are both
related to the time of peak height velocity, it is likely that maturation plays
a role in the development of the functional muscle-bone unit.

Studies that have examined the muscle-bone unit have used radiation-based
technologies to indirectly measure bone strength using size-related measures
(areal bone density, content, area). Transaxial quantitative ultrasound (QUS)
measures the speed of sound (SOS) *along* the bone, making its assessment
independent of bone size, allowing for better comparisons between and among
children of different sizes and ages (Baroncelli, 2008; Foldes et al., 1995).
QUS measures reflect both quantitative and qualitative properties of bone, as
the SOS measure is reflective of BMD, elasticity and microarchitecture of bone
(Baroncelli, 2008; Jaworski et al., 1995; Prins et al., 1998). Specifically, the
parameters are related to bone density and internal structure (Gluer et al.,
1994) but not to cortical thickness (Njeh et al., 1999). QUS has been shown to
be useful for screening of bone fragility in youth (Rebocho et al., 2014) and
has previously been used to demonstrate the effect of exercise training or
physical activity on various bones (e.g., tibia) and in different age groups
including children (Daly et al. 1997; Falk et al. 2007, 2010; Holmes et al.
2010; Klentrou and Ludwa 2011).

Previous longitudinal studies on the muscle-bone unit used measures of muscle
size (e.g., muscle cross-sectional area or lean body mass), rather than muscle
function. This approach is based on the notion that muscle strength generally
scales with muscle size and assumes appropriate measures of size are sufficient
for muscle-bone unit investigations (Petit et al., 2005). Only one study has
examined the relationship between muscle power assessed by a field test of
function (vertical jump) and tibia bone strength in adolescents. They used
peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) to provide quantitative
measures of bone strength indices along the length of the tibia, and a mediation
approach to demonstrate that muscle power is a strong predictor of lower body
bone strength. Similar to the vertical jump, grip force is a simple way to
assess muscle strength at the forearm, and has been related to distal radial
bone strength in older men and women (Hasewega et al., 2011). A few
cross-sectional studies conducted in healthy children have demonstrated positive
associations between grip strength and whole body bone mineral content (BMC)
(Gracia-Marco et al. 2011; Vicente-Rodríguez et al. 2008), upper arm BMC
(Gracia-Marco et al. 2011), calcaneal bone properties (Herrmann et al. 2015) and
radial speed of sound (Ludwa et al. 2017). However, no longitudinal study has
examined the relationship between radial bone properties and muscle strength,
and only one study has examined the relationship between tibia bone properties
and muscle strength in children and adolescents.

This study examines the Functional Model of Bone Development in peri-pubertal
boys and girls. Specifically, we test the underlying relationships between
muscle strength and non-mechanical factors that modulate the mechanostat effects
on bone strength. The Functional model of Bone Development postulates that bone
properties are regulated by a feedback loop between tissue strain and bone
strength. Children and adolescents are ideal participants to examine the
underlying relationships bone development because their substantive periods of
physical growth force the homeostatic system to continually to adapt to external
challenges (Figure 1). Our research design implements a mixed-longitudinal
design and our empirical approach develops hierarchical structural models that
accounts for latent participant effects and mediates the effects of
non-mechanical factors that modulate the mechanostat effects through muscle
strength.

**MATERIALS AND METHODS**

**Research Design and Participants**

The study utilized a mixed-longitudinal design. Children and adolescents aged
8-16 were recruited from schools located in Southern Ontario, Canada. Data were
collected from participants annually at Brock University's Applied Physiology
Laboratory. To minimize potential seasonal effects, data collection took place
during the spring and fall months (Riddoch et al., 2007). The first data
collection session took place in the spring of 2010 and last session in the
spring of 2013. As a result, four sessions occurred during the spring and three
during the fall.

Each data collection session involved two participant-visits, one week apart.
During the first visit, anthropometric measures were taken and isometric knee
extensor strength tests were conducted. Participants also completed a
questionnaire regarding potential medical concerns and physical activity habits
and were provided with an accelerometer to wear and track his or her physical
activity during the week between laboratory visits. Participants were also
provided with a sterile collection cup for a urine sample. During the second
visit, accelerometers and urine samples were collected, and grip strength tests,
bone ultrasound scans, and a 24-hour recall nutritional interview were
conducted. Compensation was provided at the end of the second visit.

Ninety-four children or adolescents participated in the spring sessions and 86
participated in the fall sessions, resulting in 180 total participants. Of the
180 participants, 36 attended one annual session, 53 attended two, 72 attended
three, and 19 attended four sessions, resulting in 434 participant-session
observations. However, not all participant-sessions resulted in data available
for analysis purposes. Six observations were omitted because the participant was
identified to have Type 1 Diabetes, eight observations were omitted because the
participant suffered a fracture, 11 observations were omitted because the
participant was identified as obese, and 3 observations were omitted because the
participant missed the second visit. Grip-strength measurements were not taken
during the Fall 2010 season. Therefore, 43 observations do not include a
grip-strength measurement. Accelerometer scores are unavailable for 108
observations in which a minimum of 10 hours per day for 3 weekdays and one
weekend day was recorded, and Ntx/creatine levels are unavailable for 29
observations for which the participant did not provide a urine sample.

The data set available for analysis consists 406 participant-session
observations, of which 363 observations include grip strength measurements, 
289 include accelerometer scores, and 376 include Ntx/creatine levels. 
Their is an even distribution of boys and girls. Approximately 51.5 percent of participants are boys. 

**Anthropometry and Maturity**

Standing and sitting height were measured using a stadiometer (Ellard
Instrumentation, Monroe, WA, USA) mounted to a wall and recorded to the nearest
0.1cm. Seated height was subtracted from standing height to calculate leg
length. Body mass was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a calibrated balance
beam scale (Zenith Digital Scale). Skinfold thickness was measured in triplicate
at two sites (triceps and subscapular) using Harpenden calipers (British
Indicators, Herts, England), and the median recorded. If the range in the
triplicate measures was greater than 1mm, a fourth measurement was taken and the
mean of the two median variables was recorded. Adiposity (percent body fat) was
estimated from the sum of these skinfolds, using age- and maturity-specific
equations, as described by Slaughter et al. (1988).

Participant’s maturity offset (years from age of peak height velocity), an
indicator of somatic maturity, was estimated using sex-specific regression
equations (Mirwald et al., 2002). It was determined from measurements of height,
seated height, leg length, body mass and chronological age, and it was adjusted
in accordance with the measurement at the age closest to the estimated age of
age of peak height velocity. All anthropometric measurements were performed by
the same investigator. The intra-operator coefficient of variation of the
skinfold measurements in 10 children was 2.4% and the interclass correlation
coefficient (ICC) was 0.996.

**Muscle Strength**

Maximal dominant forearm strength was assessed by a hand-help dynamometer to
determine maximal isometric grip force. The device handle was adjusted to the
participant’s grip and the test performed with the participant in a standing
position with their dominant arm abducted at about 45 degrees elbow extended
(Lorbergs et al., 2011). Participants were instructed to squeeze the instrument
as hard as possible for 3 seconds. Measurements were recorded to the nearest 0.5
kg. Contractions were performed 3 times and the participant’s largest value
(best trial) was used to represent their absolute maximal isometric grip force.
Proper technique was monitored to minimize postural compensations and corrected
as necessary. Isometric grip strength has been widely studied and reported for
both genders throughout childhood and adolescence (Blimkie, 1989). In addition,
a high test-retest reliability of the handgrip strength test has been reported
in untrained children (Espana-Romero et al., 2008), and untrained and trained
adolescents (Clerke et al., 2005; Gerodimos, 2012).

Isometric knee extensors strength measurements were performed on the dominant
leg, using a Biodex System III dynamometer (Biodex, Shirley, NY). The
participants were seated in the dynamometer’s chair and stabilized using a
cross-hip strap and two diagonal, cross-chest shoulder straps. The dynamometer
lever-arm contact pad was adjusted to \~3 cm above the lateral malleolus via an
ankle strap. The lever’s axis of rotation was aligned with the knee’s axis
(femur’s lateral condyle). The knee was then set at a 90° starting position
(180° = full extension). A familiarization and warm-up protocol consisted of
several submaximal isometric contractions and two maximal isometric
contractions. If a participant did not feel comfortable with the movement or the
protocol, or exhibited performance inconsistency by the end of the
familiarization sets, additional trials were administered.

The subsequent testing consisted of eight 3-s maximal isometric knee extensions
at 90°, separated by a minimum of 30-s rest between repetitions. Prior to each
contraction, participants were instructed to “kick out as fast and then as hard
as possible” from a completely relaxed state. Verbal encouragement was given,
along with visual torque-level feedback on the Biodex monitor. Torque signals
were recorded prior to and throughout each contraction. The highest peak torque
was recorded.

**Bone Properties**

Transaxial quantitative ultrasound (QUS, Sunlight Omnisense™ 7000S, Sunlight
Medical, Israel) was used to assess bone strength by measuring the SOS (m/s)
along the bone at the distal 1/3 of the radius and mid-tibia of the dominant
limbs. The strength of bone is determined by the shortest time elapsed between
the transmission and reception of the signal transmission, with faster
transmissions reflecting stronger bone (Njeh et al., 1999). The area of
measurement for the radius was the midpoint between the olecranon process and
the tip of the third phalanx; wide scans of 140 degrees around the radius were
performed. To measure the SOS of the tibial shaft, a line was marked midway
between the apex of the top of the knee and the sole of the foot, with the
subject in a sitting position and the knee at a 90° angle. The probe was placed
parallel to the tibial bone surface, and a scan from the medial to lateral side
was performed. All measurements consisted of at least three consistent cycles. A
system quality verification of the QUS was performed with a Perspex phantom
before the first test of each day. Although every effort was made for one
operator to solely perform all QUS measurements for the duration of the
longitudinal study, this was not always possible. Thus, the first operator
performed almost all SOS measurements with an intra-operator coefficient of
variation in 10 children of 2% and an interclass correlation coefficient of
0.98. The inter-operator coefficient of variation was 3%.

**Nutrition and Physical Activity**

Dietary intake was evaluated using a 24-hour recall interview as previously
described (Ludwa et al. 2017). The 24-hour recall method is the most commonly
used assessment tool in large cross-sectional surveys and skeletal development
studies in both children and adults (Moore et al. 2010). In brief, participants
were asked to recall everything consumed (including foods, beverages, sauces and
condiments) the day prior to the interview. Prior to answering the 24-hour
dietary recall, participants were asked if the last 24 hours were typical for
their diet. If it were not a *typical* day (e.g. birthday party, family
gathering, eating out), they reported two days prior to the interview date. The
recall started from the first meal or beverage consumed at waking until midnight
of the reporting day. Pictures representing different portion sizes of foods,
sizes and measurements of various kitchenware models were used to help ascertain
the most accurate amount of food that was consumed. Dietary analysis was
conducted (using Nutritionist ProTM, Axxya Systems, USA) to estimate total daily
energy intake (kcal), as well as daily protein (g), calcium (mg) and vitamin D
(µg) intake.

Habitual physical activity was assessed using Actigraph GT1M accelerometers. The
accelerometers were programmed to record activity counts at 5-second epochs
along the vertical axis to measure accelerations from 0.05-2 G’s at a frequency
of 0.25-2.5 Hz. Participants were instructed to wear the belted accelerometer
for 7 consecutive days, against the skin, on the right hip for all waking hours.
Physical activity logs were used to record times the accelerometer was removed
(i.e., during bathing, swimming, competition). A minimum of three weekdays and
one weekend day, with a minimum of 10 hours of waking data recorded, were used
for analysis (Penpraze et al. 2006). Based on previously established cut-off
values (Trost et al. 2001, 2002) the total combined time spent in moderate,
hard, and very hard types of habitual activities (MVH) was used to quantify
habitual daily physical activity.

In addition to the MVH, we also used the Godin-Shephard Leisure Time Exercise
Questionnaire (Godin and Shephard 1985) in order to account for activities not
captured by the accelerometers (eg. swimming), which involve the upper body and
may have an effect on radial SOS. Participants were asked to indicate the number
of times in a typical week they engaged in mild, moderate and strenuous physical
activity for at least 15 minutes. These frequencies were then multiplied by
estimated energy consumption values (in metabolic equivalents [METs]) and summed
in order to obtain total weekly leisure time physical activity metabolic
equivalent (WAeq) scores. This questionnaire has demonstrated adequate validity
and reliability in children and adults (Jacobs et al. 1993; Sallis et al. 1993;
Scerpella et al. 2002).

**Bone Resorption**

Cross-linked N-telopeptides of bone type I collagen (Ntx) was measured to
monitor bone resorption, i.e. osteoclast activity. Ntx was measured in first
morning mid-stream urine samples and analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) kits (Osteomark® Ntx Urine Assay, Alere Scarborough, Inc., USA).
All samples were analyzed in duplicate with the mean of the duplicate
absorbancies used to determine Ntx concentrations. All assayed plates were read
using the same microplate reader and absorbencies analyzed using GraphPad Prism
(GraphPad Software, Inc., USA). Urinary creatinine was analyzed in duplicate
using a creatinine colormetric assay kit (MicroVue™, Quidel Corporation,
SanDiego, CA, USA) based on a modified Jaffe method. Ntx values were corrected
for urinary creatinine and final results reported as nmol BCE/mmol creatinine.
The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficient of variation for Ntx was, 2.5% and
11.6%, respectively.

One hundred and seventy-two participants (92 boys and 80 girls) were repeatedly
examined. The result was a hierarchical data set that consisted of within (level
1) and between (level 2) measurement variations. The final data consisted of 425
(226 from boys and 199 from girls) participant measurement-occasion
observations. Table 1 presents the mean bone properties and muscle strength
measurements across measurement-occasions. As expected, bone properties and
muscle strength measurements increased with time. On average, girls had a
greater increase in bone properties (radial: 3.2% vs. 1.6%; tibial: 4.2% vs
3.7%) and boys had greater increases in muscle strength (grip: 54.7% vs. 24.7%;
knee extensors: 33.6% vs. 20.6%).

A multilevel structural equation model (i.e., SEM) was used to describe bone
properties changes as postulated by the functional model of bone development.
According to this model, specific modulators influence muscle strength, which in
turn, along with other cellular modulators related to osteoblasts/osteoclasts,
influence bone properties (see Figure 1). Models were constructed using Stata
14’s Generalized Structural Equation package (see Kaplan, 2008; Kline, 2015 for
an overview of structural equation modeling). In brief, SEM is a multivariate
statistical technique used to estimate a system of equations and test hypotheses
about the relationships among variables. To do so, SEM explicates the direct
relationships between observed variables and the covariance relationships
between unobserved variables.

Figure 1. The conceptual Functional Model of Bone Development (Rauch and
Schoenau, 2001).

In general, bone properties changes are expressed as

$$
{bp_{i,j} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}\text{ms}_{i,j} + \mathbf{Z}_{\mathbf{i,j}}^{\mathbf{'}} + \gamma_{i} + \epsilon_{i,j}\backslash n}{\text{ms}_{i,j} = \mathbf{W}_{\mathbf{i,j}}^{\mathbf{'}}\Theta + \mu_{i,j}\ }
$$

where the subscript i denotes the measurement-occasion and j the participant.
The $$bp_{i,j}$$ and $$\text{ms}_{i,j}$$ terms denote the bone properties and
muscle strength measurements, and the **W** and **Z** terms denote matrices of
modulators. The $$\epsilon_{i,j}$$ and $$\mu_{i,j}$$ terms denote the unobserved
level-1 (within-participant) residuals and the $$\lambda_{i,j}$$ term denotes
level-2 (between-participant) unobserved random effect, which is assumed to be
normally distributed with a mean of zero and independent of the muscle strength
and modulatory (**Z**) variables. A path diagram of the specific model
specification adopted is presented in Figure 2. The specification consists of
two bone properties (radial and tibial SOS) and two muscle strength (isometric
grip and knee extensors strength) equations.

Squared terms denote observed variables measured on occasion i in the j-th
participant. As indicated on the left side of the diagram, radial and tibial SOS
proxy for bone properties, isometric grip and knee extensors strength proxy for
muscle strength, and Ntx/creatine proxies for osteoclast activity, and effector
signals. In terms of modulators, maturity offset proxies for physical maturity,
energy intake proxies for nutrition; and WEeq, and MVH proxies for physical
activity behaviour. Single-circled terms denote the level-1 residuals, and the
double-circled terms denote level-2 unobserved random effects. Single-headed
straight-arrowed paths denote a direct relationship between variables (i.e.,
fixed slope effects), and a doubled-headed curved-arrowed specifies that
unobservable variances covary. The system of equations is estimated via maximum
likelihood and built using a stepwise procedure based a 0.05 level significant
criteria and the log-likelihood ratio statistic.

**Results**

To facilitate straightforward comparison of the causal effects, all variables
were transformed/standardized to a mean of zero and standard deviation of one.
Conclusions based on non-standardized values were similar and support identical
inferences. The results are also presented in Figure 2. The estimated fixed
(slope) effects are presented along the straight-arrowed paths, and
intercepts/constant terms are within the dependent variable terms. The estimated
level-1 variances are beside circle terms, the level-2 variances are within the
doubled-circled terms, and the covariances are along the doubled-headed
curved-arrowed paths. All variables were significant at the 0.05 level. The
model equations along with detailed results and supplemental analyses are
available at https://github.com/kmongeon/exercise_physiology.

Associated coefficients are similar across equations. In terms of the isometric
grip and knee extensors equations, the physical maturity (maturity offset: 0.00
= 0.60 – 0.60, p\>0.05), nutrition (energy intake: -0.02 = 0.14 – 0.16,
p\>0.05), behavioural (WAeq: 0.08 = 0.17 – 0.08, p\>0.05) and intercept
(0.00=0.00-0.00; p\>0.05) coefficients are not significantly different from
another. In terms of the radial and tibial equations, the muscle strength (grip
and knee extensors: -0.15 = 0.24-0.40, p\>0.05), osteoclast activity (Ntx:-0.13
= -0.18-(-0.14), p\>0.05), physical maturation modulators (-0.013= 0.31-032,
p\>0.05), behavioural modulators (-0.03 = 0.05-0.08, p\>0.05), and intercept
(0.00=-0.02-(-0.02); p\>0.05) coefficients are not significant different from
one another. There are also no significant differences (p\>0.05) in the level-1
muscle strength residuals/variances, the level-1 bone properties
residuals/variances, and the level-2 random-participant variances. [^1]
Therefore, we estimated results from a specification that constrained the
associated coefficients, the level-1 muscle strength residuals, the level-1 bone
properties residuals, and the level-2 random-participant effects to be equal,
and the intercept terms to zero (Figure 3).

[^1]: Discrepancy in the differences from individual components are due to
rounding.

The constrained estimation results are consistent with the relationships
postulated by the functional model of bone development. Specifically, physical
maturity, nutrition, and behavioral modulators influence muscle strength, which
in-turn, along osteoclast activity, and physical maturity and behavioral
modulators influences bone properties (p\<0.05). Each standard deviation
increase in physical maturation leads to increases in muscle strength by
approximately a 0.60 standard deviations. In standard units, the impact of
nutrition and physical activity on…. is 0.15 and 0.12, respectively. The bone
properties equation coefficients are also interpreted as standard deviation unit
changes. Note, the conditional fixed effects account for level-2 participant
variances. A unit increase in osteoclast activity decreases bone SOS 0.16 units.
Physical activity, physical maturation and muscle strength have positive
returns. Each unit increases in physical activity increases bone SOS 0.05 units.
The physical maturation and muscle strength effects are 0.31 and 0.33 standard
units, respectively. Physical maturation, as well as the other muscle strength
modulators, also an indirect influence on bone properties through muscle
strength (i.e., $$\frac{\partial
bone_{i,j}}{\partial\text{muscle}_{i,j}}\frac{\partial
muscle_{i,j}}{\partial\text{matu}_{i,j}} = 0.33 \times 0.60 = 0.20$$). In total,
the influence of physical maturation is 0.52 (= 0.33 + 0.20) standard units.

*Sex-specific results.*

The fixed estimates for boys and girls are presented in Table 2.[^2] Boys had
greater returns to physical maturation on muscle strength (0.21, p\<0.05), and
girls had greater returns to physical maturation (0.28, p\<0.05) and muscle
strength (0.17) on bone properties. In boys, the direct, indirect, and total
influences of physical maturation on bone properties was 0.17, 0.21
(=0.70x0.30), and 0.38 (=0.17+0.21). In girls, the influences are 0.45, 0.22
(=047x0.49), and 0.68 (=0.45+0.22). Although girls gain less muscle strength
from maturation, the greater direct benefit and indirect benefit received
through muscle strength results in greater total benefits.

To summarize, the empirical models supports (does not reject) the functional
model of bone development. Similar random variances and fixed coefficients
estimates across the grip and knee extensors strength, as well as the radial and
tibial equations enabled a general model specification and generalizable muscle
strength and bone properties conclusions. Most notably, physical maturation
influences muscle strength, which in-turn, along with physical maturation,
influences bone properties. The effects are different for boys and girls. Boys
gain much of their bone SOS through the indirect effect of physical maturation
on muscle strength. Girls gain most of their bone SOS through the direct effects
of physical maturation and muscle strength on bone properties.
