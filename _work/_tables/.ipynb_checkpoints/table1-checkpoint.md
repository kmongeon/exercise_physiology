The table below shows average fuel efficiency in gallons per 100 miles for foreign 
and domestic cars before and after adjustment for weight:

| Car Type   | Unadjusted            | Adjusted                  |
|:-----------|----------------------:|--------------------------:|
| Foreign    |  {{.2}}  | {{.3}}       |

Foreign cars use less fuel than domestic cars but are also lighter,
when we compare cars with the same weight the imports use 
six-tenths of a gallon more per 100 miles than the domestic cars.
