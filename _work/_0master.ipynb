    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This study provides experimental evidence in support of the conceptual functional model of bone development postulating that the primary mechanical challenges to boneâ€™s mechanostat during growth is increases in muscle force. This longitudinal study measured radial and tibial bone properties, isometric grip and knee extensors strength, and maturity in 172 children aged 8-15 years 2-3 times over a period of 3 years. Both the conceptual model and research design motivates the multilevel structural equation that explicates the relationship between strength and physical maturation on bone properties."

    "## Research Design and Participants\n",
    "\n",
    "The study utilized a mixed-longitudinal design. Children and adolescents aged 8-16 were recruited from schools located in Southern Ontario, Canada. Data were collected from participants annually at Brock University's Applied Physiology Laboratory. To minimize potential seasonal effects, data collection took place during the spring and fall months (Riddoch et al., 2007). The first data collection session took place in the spring of 2010 and last session in the spring of 2013. As a result, four sessions occurred during the spring and three during the fall. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each data collection session involved two participant-visits, one week apart. During the first visit, anthropometric measures were taken and isometric knee extensor strength tests were conducted. Participants also completed a questionnaire regarding potential medical concerns and physical activity habits and were provided with an accelerometer to wear and track his or her physical activity during the week between laboratory visits. Participants were also provided with a sterile collection cup for a urine sample. During the second visit, accelerometers and urine samples were collected, and grip strength tests, bone ultrasound scans, and a 24-hour recall nutritional interview were conducted. Compensation was provided at the end of the second visit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ninety-four children or adolescents participated in the spring sessions and 86 participated in the fall sessions, resulting in 180 total participants. Of the 180 participants, 36 attended one annual session, 53 attended two, 72 attended three, and 19 attended four sessions, resulting in 434 participant-session observations. However, not all participant-sessions resulted in data available for analysis purposes. Six observations were omitted because the participant was identified to have Type 1 Diabetes, eight observations were omitted because the participant suffered a fracture, 11 observations were omitted because the participant was identified as obese, and 3 observations were omitted because the participant missed the second visit. Grip-strength measurements were not taken during the Fall 2010 season. Therefore, 43 observations do not include a grip-strength measurement. Accelerometer scores are unavailable for 108 observations in which a minimum of 10 hours per day for 3 weekdays and one weekend day was recorded, and Ntx/creatine levels are unavailable for 29 observations for which the participant did not provide a urine sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data set available for analysis consists 406 participant-session observations, of which 306 observations include grip strength measurements, 289 include accelerometer scores, and 376 include Ntx/creatine levels. "

    "## Statistical analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The repeated sampling of participants resulted in a hierarchical data set that consisted of within (level 1) and between (level 2) measurement variations. Table 1 outlines the variables used in the analysis, their means, and their standard deviations within and between participants. Shapiro-Wilk's tests did not reject the null hypothesis that the radial and tibial bone property distributions are normally distribution. Radial SOS measured an average of 129 points greater than tibial SOS (p=0.00). Girls, on average, has greater bone property measurements than boys; radial SOS by 19 (p=0.0495) and tibial SOS 22 points (0.0376). "

    "The repeated sampling of participants resulted in a hierarchical data set that consisted of within (level 1) and between (level 2) measurement variations. Table 1 outlines the variables used in the analysis, their means, and their standard deviations within and between participants. Shapiro-Wilk's tests did not reject the null hypothesis that the radial and tibial bone property distributions are normally distribution. Radial SOS measured an average of 129 points greater than tibial SOS (p=0.00). Girls, on average, has greater bone property measurements than boys; radial SOS by 19 (p=0.0495) and tibial SOS 22 points (0.0376). \n",

    "The bone property variances exhibited two distinct characteristics. One is that notable between and within variances existed. Another is that their was greater variation across participants (i.e., between) than across time (i.e., within). The standard deviation of radial SOS measurements across participants (i.e., between) was 86 m/s compared to 51 m/s. The across and with participant standard deviation of tibial SOS was 96 and 50 m/s, respectively. Each independent variable also had a greater between compared to within variance to suggest that a fixed-participant estimation procedure may lead to considerable efficiency loss and a random-participant model is appropriate.\n",

    "The functional model of bone development provides the conceptual framework to model bone property changes. Rather than a direct causal effect between modulators and bone properties, the functional model of bone development postulates that modulators inflence muscle strength, which in turn influences bone properties (see Figure 1). A multilevel structural equation model  (i.e., SEM) was developed to test the intrinusic relationships between modulators, muscle strength, and bone properties. \n",

The mediation literature often ignores the point that Direct Effects are subject to some ambiguity: they can arise from inputs changed by the experiment that are not observed by the analyst, but can also arise from changes in the map between inputs and the outputs.\n",
